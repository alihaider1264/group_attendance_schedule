This is a simple Python program that generates the schedule for combinations of class meeting days (TR, MWF) and course modalitlies (A/B, A/B/C).

Due to COVID-19, universities have been forced to reduce class size to 25% of actual class capacity in NY. As a result students must be divided into groups and a group (not all) of students attend class in-person on any given day. This Python program will help faculty members quickly generate a meeting schedule for each group.
Once the schedule is generated:
1) Make groups of students in your class.
2) Announce the schedule to students so that everyone knows when they attend in-person.

The program has been tested and generates correct schedule however, no liability lies with the author in case of incorrect output. Quickly check a sample to confirm that all dates are correct.

Run through Command Line:

Open command prompt
Get to the folder where you downloaded the .py file
Type 
Python grp_schedule.py

or run directly in your Python IDE of choice.

The program generates a text file with group schedule in the same folder as .py file.
